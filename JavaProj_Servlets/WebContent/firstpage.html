	  This is the first HTML file that the program runs first. 
	  This connects to the "/first" URL that connects it to the 
	  first Servlet. Here, a couple fields are created and ask
	  for user input. General details are asked from the student.
	  Each input has a name that allow the Servlet	
	  to determine the different fields. A submit button is also
	  placed to continue to the next HTML document.
